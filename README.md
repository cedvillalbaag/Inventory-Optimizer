# 📦 Inventory Parameter Calculation Tool

## 📝 Project Description
This repository contains an MS Excel tool designed to calculate key inventory management parameters for a company. The goal is to optimize stock levels, minimizing storage costs and avoiding operational disruptions. This tool provides a solid foundation for informed and efficient decision-making in the supply chain.

## 📊 Parameters and Functionalities
The tool calculates and displays the following parameters:
- Safety Stock: The reserve inventory required to mitigate uncertainty in demand and delivery times, avoiding stockouts.
- ROP (Reorder Point): The stock level at which a new order must be placed to prevent inventory from falling below safety stock during the lead time.
- EOQ (Economic Order Quantity): The optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs (ordering costs + carrying costs).
- MIN/MAX (Minimum and Maximum Levels): Establish stock thresholds for each material, facilitating simple, visual management.

## 🌟 Impacts and Benefits for the Company
- Cost Reduction: Allows the company to minimize storage and ordering costs by finding the optimal balance point.
- Improved Operational Efficiency: By being clear about when and how much to order, the purchasing process is simplified and emergency inventory counts are avoided.
- Avoiding Stockouts: Calculating safety stock ensures that the company can meet customer demand even in the face of unforeseen events, improving satisfaction and reliability.
- Working Capital Optimization: Avoiding excess inventory frees up capital that can be used in other strategic areas of the business.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Tool
- Download the InventoryParameters.xlsx file from this repository.
- Enter input data, such as average demand, lead time, desired service level, ordering and holding costs, in the designated cells.
